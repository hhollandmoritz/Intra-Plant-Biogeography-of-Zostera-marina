Plant 2-6: For plant 2-6 a more targeted approach was taken. For each plant, a single leaf shoot was chosen and divided into roughly equally-sized pieces. Rhizomes were also divided into roughly equally sized pieces (again each piece contained no more than one root bundle). In the case of both the leaf and rhizome distance from the base of the shoot was recorded. Knowing that segmented roots would yield sufficient DNA for extraction, six roots were selected from each plant for segmentation. Three of these roots came from a root bundle closest to the leaf and three came from a root bundle farther out on the rhizome. As in plant 1, each root was divided into four equally-sized segments which we refer to as tip, mid1, mid2 and base.

After sectioning, samples from plants 2-6 were placed directly into MoBio Powersoil bead-beating tubes and frozen at -20 degrees prior to extraction.
