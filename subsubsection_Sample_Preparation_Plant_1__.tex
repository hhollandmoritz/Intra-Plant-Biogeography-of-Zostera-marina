\subsubsection{Sample Preparation}

Plant 1: Before extraction, each plant was cut into roughly 50 pieces. The first plant was cut into forty-six pieces (summarized in the figure below). Previous data (unpublished) had shown obvious differences between tissue types, so our study focused on fine-scale community variation within each tissue type rather than among them. Briefly, leaves were cut into twenty roughly equally-sized pieces (about five centimeters each). The relative position of each piece was recorded. Similarly, the rhizome was sectioned into six segments. Each rhizome segment was between 1.5 and 2 centimeters in length and contained no more than a single root bundle.
