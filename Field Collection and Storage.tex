\subsubsection{\textbf{Field Collection and Storage}}

    Six plants were collected from \textit{Zostera marina} meadows in Bodega Bay, CA. We collected the first plant in late November of 2013. The other five plants were collected in early February of 2015 as a follow-up study of the first. We stored all plants at -80$^{\circ}$C prior to DNA extraction.
