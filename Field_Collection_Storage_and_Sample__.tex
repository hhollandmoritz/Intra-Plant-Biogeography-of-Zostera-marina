Field Collection Storage and Sample Preparation:
All six plants were collected from meadows at Bodega Bay, CA. We collected the first plant in [time/date] of 2014. The other five plants were collected in early February of 2015 as a follow-up study of the first. We stored all plants at -80 degrees until the DNA was extracted.
