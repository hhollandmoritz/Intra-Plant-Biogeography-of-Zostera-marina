\subsubsection{Field Collection and Storage}

All six plants were collected from \textit{Zostera marina} meadows in Bodega Bay, CA. We collected the first plant in [time/date] of 2014. The other five plants were collected in early February of 2015 as a follow-up study of the first. We stored all plants at -80 degrees prior to DNA extraction. 

\subsubsection{, and Sample Preparation}
Directly before extraction, each plant was cut into roughly 50 pieces. The first plant was cut into forty-six pieces (summarized in the figure below).
