\subsubsection{Field Collection and Storage}

All six plants were collected from \textit{Zostera marina} meadows in Bodega Bay, CA. We collected the first plant in [time/date] of 2014. The other five plants were collected in early February of 2015 as a follow-up study of the first. We stored all plants at -80 degrees prior to DNA extraction. 

\subsubsection{Sample Preparation}

Before extraction, each plant was cut into roughly 50 pieces. The first plant was cut into forty-six pieces (summarized in the figure below). Because previous data (unpublished) had shown obvious differences between tissue types, our study focused on fine-scale community variation within the leaves, rhizomes, and roots. Briefly, leaves were cut into twenty roughly equally-sized pieces (about five centimeters each). The relative position of each piece was recorded. Similarly, the rhizome was sectioned into six segments. Each rhizome segment was between 1.5 and 2 centimeters in length and contained no more than a single root bundle.
